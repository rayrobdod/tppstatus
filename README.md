## Preresiquites
* git (somewhat obviously)
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (which itself requires a recent version of java)

## The basic flow to update run data

0. checkout/clone/etc repository
1. edit the [*.json](http://json.org/) files in the `src/main/assets` directory
2. in the repository's root directory, run the command `sbt web-stage`
  * this will create the `target/web/stage` directory and files in that directory
3. commit/push the root directory (the .gitignore should catch any files
  generated by sbt) to master
4. commit/push the files in `target/web/stage` to the gh-pages branch - treating
  `target/web/stage` as the root of that operation

## Directory Structure

* project - meta information
  * PageTemplates.scala - the code that formats the data as html 
  * package.scala - classes that hold data and retrieve it from json. 
  * build.scala, build.sbt, plugins.sbt - information about the sbt build process
* src
  * main
    * assets - the run data in json form
    * public - static assets (images, css, etc)
* target - not put in repository
  * web
    * stage - the output of the build process. The files that go in `gh-pages`
